### Prerequisites

### API Key Setup

1. Get a free API key from [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/)
2. Copy `local.properties.example` to `local.properties`:
   ```bash
   cp local.properties.example local.properties
   ```
3. Open the `local.properties` file and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```properties
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
4. The `local.properties` file is already in `.gitignore`, so your API key won't be committed to version control

   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Set up your API key as described above

4. Build and run the project
